how to create a new django project

create a virtual environment first using- py -m venv virtualenvironmentname(venv for eg. )
activate virtual environment- venv\Scripts\Activate
this will activate the virtual env and now we can actually install django in it using - pip install django
now we have to start a new project with - django-admin startproject [projectname] .(this dot is useful because it puts everything in one
folder and we wont have to do anything to it)
now we can add apps to it by - py manage.py startapp [appname]


Now to create superuser, first we have to migrate, to do that- py manage.py makemigrations
then - py manage.py migrate
now you can  successfully use admin and create superuser
